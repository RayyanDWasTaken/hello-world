# hello-world
If you are seeing this, there is a decent chance I might not make it to next week.
I don't want to go further in about this, or write notes and all that about what is happening, I am too lazy for that.
If I do make it, then please try to end me.
I correspond this to many sorts of toxicity towards me and others.
Last I can really say is,
# Goodbye.
